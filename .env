# Sample .env file for docker-compose.yml
#
# For Linux:
DISPLAY=:0
UID=1000
GID=1000

# For Windows (with Docker Desktop and X server):
# DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0
# UID=1000
# GID=1000

# Uncomment and adjust the DISPLAY line above for your OS as needed.
# UID and GID can be set to your user values, or left as 1000 for most cases.
